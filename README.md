# findPolynomialFactors
Uses the zero sum method to factor polynomials

This program assumes the polynomial in question is in standard form.
This program only finds "clean" factors - i.e. no irrational or imaginary factors.
This program is comprehensive if there are only clean factors, but can still be used
   as a tool if there are other types of factors too.
